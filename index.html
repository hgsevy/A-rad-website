		<p> This is a website all about Lizards. The last few weeks I have been taking a picture of every lizard I come across (you can see those under the picture tab). While doing this I have discovered that lizards are kind of cool. There is one lizard that hangsout outside that is probably 2/3 tail and another who seems to do pushups quite often. I'm still not sure why the lizard does this, but you can find out other things about lizards by looking around this website.</p>

		<p> Chameleons are a type of lizard that can change color to match their surroundings. Change the color of the background below to see the chameloen change color with it <p>
